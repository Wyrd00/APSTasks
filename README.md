Amy Paul &amp; Stef's To-Do List

Our task it to create a to-do list that will fulfull the user stories. The user-stories are the following:

## User stories:

As a disorganised person I want to:

- enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
- view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
- mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
- the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb

## Potential stretch goals

As a disorganised person I want to:

- edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
- click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
- a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing

The To-Do Lill encompass the following:

- Have a box containing the elements
